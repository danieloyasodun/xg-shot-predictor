# Frontend

## Purpose:
This folder contains all the source code for the frontend of the **XG Shot Predictor** web application. It is built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** (or other CSS frameworks, depending on your choice). The frontend is responsible for displaying the dashboard, the football pitch, interactive shot locations, and the expected goals (xG) predictions.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of the football pitch.
- **Shot Prediction**: Click on any point on the pitch to get the xG of a shot from that position.
- **Data Visualization**: Display xG data and other relevant statistics using charts and graphs.
- **User Interface**: Responsive, user-friendly design for easy navigation and interaction.

## How to Run:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash

3. Run the development server:
