Resume-Ready Project Description:

    xG Shot Predictor Web App
    Built an interactive football pitch web app where users can click anywhere to visualize the expected goal (xG) value of a shot from that location. Used D3.js for the pitch UI, trained an ML model on historical shot data, and deployed it using FastAPI + AWS Lambda. Integrated real-time prediction API and interactive data visualization.

Built an interactive football pitch web app where users click to simulate shots and receive real-time xG predictions, using React, D3.js, and a machine learning model trained on historical match data.

Deployed a serverless backend with FastAPI and AWS Lambda, integrating a custom xG model for live inference and hosted the project via AWS S3 and API Gateway for scalable access.
