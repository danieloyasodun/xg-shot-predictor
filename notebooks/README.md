# Notebook

## Purpose:
This folder contains **Jupyter Notebooks** or **Python scripts** used for experimentation, data analysis, and building the **xG (Expected Goals) model**. Here you can experiment with the shot prediction model, train the model using existing match data, and test various approaches for predicting xG based on player and shot characteristics.

## Key Features:
- **xG Model**: Develop, test, and evaluate the xG prediction model.
- **Data Exploration**: Analyze datasets (e.g., player stats, shot locations) to understand trends and relationships.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict xG values.

## How to Use:
1. Install Jupyter (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```
2. Navigate to the `notebook` folder:
    ```bash
    cd notebook
    ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Open and run the relevant `.ipynb` files to explore and develop the xG prediction model.

## Files and Folders:
- `xg_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with model development for predicting xG based on historical data.
- `data_cleaning.py`: Python script for cleaning and preprocessing raw data.
- `xg_experiment.py`: Python script for testing different xG prediction algorithms.
